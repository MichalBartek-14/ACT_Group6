# Introduction
....
## Preprocessing
Preprocessing is mainly about changing the format of the data in a 
way that it can be easily visualized. _00_RetrievingGPRsignal.py_ attempts 
to convert LAZ to LAS and add a georeference to it. _00_VisualisingLAZ.py_
explores how to best visualize a LAZ file. _00_VisualisingMesh.py_ experiments 
with two ways of visualising a mesh file created through photogrammetry.
