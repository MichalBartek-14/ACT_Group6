# checklist for cleaning code:
1. all variable names short and clear
2. correct indenting, tabs and enters
3. docstring present with params
4. no errors when (ALL) code is being run
5. remove unused imports

Things to do at the end: 
1. check for double used code. if double code, use imports instead!
2. explain in readme:
   1. explain how code should be run!
   2. explain what every file does
   3. mention names of people that worked on this code (mees michal eleanor and Dimitra)
